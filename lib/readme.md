### `AocArgParser`, `EcArgParser`

You will never guess.

### `BinaryHeap`

Binary heap with destructive and non-destructive iterators.

### `Counter`

Trivial `Map` wrapper.

### `Deque`

Fast circular array.

### `Grid`

Advent of Code does seem to like them.

### `HashedMap`, `HashedSet`

`Map` wrappers. Both require a `hasher` function. Hash is stored in the `Map`'s `key`. Original key is stored in the `Map`'s `value`.

### `Logger`

You will never guess part 2.

### `Mutex`, `Semaphore`

Simple mutex based on the functionality of `async-mutex`. `Semaphore` is a trivial `Mutex` wrapper.

### `PackedMap`, `PackedSet`

`Map` and `Set` wrappers. Both require `packer` and `unpacker` functions.

### `Point2D`, `Point3D`

Also Advent of Code favourites. Class and type-only variants.
